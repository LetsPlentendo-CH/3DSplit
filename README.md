# 3DSplits
A speedrunning timer for the (New) Nintendo 3DS (XL).

## How to use
Download the 3DSplits.3dsx from the [releases](https://github.com/LetsPlentendo-CH/3DSplits/releases) and copy it to your /3ds/ folder on the SD card of your [homebrewed 3DS](https://3ds.guide).
Launch the app from the homebrew launcher.
Have fun!

## How to build
### Prerequisites
This project was made with the devkitpro, libctru and citro2d C libraries, so you will need to install [devkitpro](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment#Setup) before building.
### Build
After setting up devkitpro, you can navigate to the /3DSplits/ folder and run `make`. Transfer the 3DSplits.3dsx file to your SD card and you're done!

## Thanks
This project would not have been possible without the awesome 3DS modding community and the devkitpro/libctru/citro2d developers.
Also, this project never would have been created if our fellow speedrunner DCA had a second phone or a PC to install a splitting app!
